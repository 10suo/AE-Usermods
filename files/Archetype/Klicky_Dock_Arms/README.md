# Klicky Dock Arms Specifically for Archetype
The suggestion for klicky with Archetype had always been to use the adjustable dock. In my experience, this works well enough, but tends to become loose and floppy over time.

Taking measurements from a stock Voron VT/V2 gantry, I purpose built dock arms to both reduce needed hardware and provide a more sturdy mounting solution.
