# V2 Z Chain Relocation
The Z chain on a stock Voron 2 will cause issues for some of the extruders for Archetype, namely the breakneck blocks, Escapement and Kyro. In order to make room for these extruders the Z chain and rear gantry extrusion have been swapped.

In order to further compatability, the top outer mounting points have been adjusted to make room for top mounted Y rails.

Additionally, in place of the typical passthrough, an M12x1.5 thread has been modeled into the top half of the A drive frame for cable glands.
