### New MeowXol faceplate

New faceplate and insert has not been tested on Xol.

Recommend printing the LED insert with arachne or a small nozzle for best results.

### Old MeowXol faceplate
New faceplate has its own insert that will not work with the old versions of the MeowXol faceplate. Use the old Xol-Toolhead LED insert [Link](https://github.com/Armchair-Engineering/Xol-Toolhead/blob/8738f04827ed52bf14f475c76bdd0ff187363ccf/STL/Faceplates/%5Bwhite%5D%20LED%20diffuser.stl)

The BigPaw version has the size of the paw increased and the back opened up so that the lighting is more even.
