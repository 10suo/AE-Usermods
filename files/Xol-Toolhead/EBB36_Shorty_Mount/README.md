# EBB36 Sherpa "Shorty" Mount
### by neon.blue

This alternate mount shortens the vertical height needed, which is ideal for a Voron Trident or similar printer without much space above the toolhead.

### Features
 * Shorter strain relief height
 * Triple zip tie mount
 * Molex connector isn't subject to head movement as much

### Stats
 * Height compared to stock: -20mm
 * Height from top of strain relief to upper panel on a stock build Trident: 75mm

## Installation Notes
When utilizing Igus Chainflex or similar, strip the shielding back to just below where the cable exits the strain relief. Most Chainflex type cables cannot do the bend required by this mount, but with the shielding removed the bare wires will do it without issue. Be sure to keep the Chainflex shielding where the zip ties hold the cable against the strain relief.
